# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict house prices. Various models, including linear regression, SVM, random forest, RNN, and feedforward neural networks, are utilized to leverage various features from the provided housing dataset for accurate predictions.

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of pandas and machine learning models (linear regression, SVM, random forest, RNN, feedforward neural networks).
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Import Libraries and Dataset

- Import necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.
- Load the provided dataset into your environment.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Remove Null Values and Duplicates:** Clean the dataset by removing any null values and duplicates to ensure the data is ready for analysis.
- **Split the Dataset:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. This is crucial for evaluating the performance of the model.

### 3. Implement Models

- **Linear Regression Model:** Apply a linear regression model on the training dataset. Fit the model to the training data and then use it to make predictions on the test data.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Implement SVM for regression and train it on the dataset.
- **Random Forest:** Utilize the random forest algorithm to build a robust model by training multiple decision trees.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** Use RNN to capture temporal dependencies and train it on the dataset.
- **Feedforward Neural Networks:** Apply feedforward neural networks for non-linear relationships in the data.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- **Evaluate the Models:** Test each model using the test dataset. Evaluate their performance by checking how accurately they predict house prices.

### 5. Testing

- **Test with Different Datasets:** Validate the robustness of your models by testing them with different datasets.
- **Experiment with Different Models:** Compare the performance of various machine learning models to determine which performs best.
